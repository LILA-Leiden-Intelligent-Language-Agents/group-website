    <h2>Welcome to LILA (Leiden Intelligence Language Agents)</h2>
    <p>
        LILA is a dedicated research group at the <strong>Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS)</strong>, Leiden University, focused on pushing the boundaries of intelligent systems. We operate as a cross-disciplinary collaboration, leveraging expertise from the <strong>Natural Computing Cluster</strong>, the <strong>Explainable AI (XAI) group</strong>, the <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP) group</strong>, and the <strong>Reinforcement Learning group</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Driven by <strong>Prof. Aske Plaat</strong> and <strong>Dr. Niki van Stein</strong>, our mission is to develop and analyze the next generation of <strong>Agentic AI</strong>&mdash;systems capable of autonomous decision-making, complex reasoning, and goal-directed actions in dynamic environments.

    <h2>Research Areas: Agentic AI and LLM Reasoning</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission centers on unlocking the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models, transforming them from passive prediction engines into sophisticated, goal-driven agents. We focus on both the theoretical foundations and the practical application of these technologies to solve highly complex problems in optimization and decision-making.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Our core activities cover a wide array of topics, combining foundational research with practical applications, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Agentic AI and Systems</strong>: Designing, implementing, and evaluating autonomous AI agents that utilize LLMs for planning, reasoning, and executing complex tasks. This includes developing frameworks for reliable and robust agent-to-agent and human-to-agent interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>LLM Reasoning and Cognition</strong>: Investigating the underlying mechanisms of reasoning within LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-correction), improving their logical coherence, and enhancing their capacity for complex problem-solving.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>LLM-Aided Optimization and Design</strong>: Using Foundation Models and LLMs as powerful tools to guide, configure, and automate the design of traditional optimization algorithms, metaheuristics, and machine learning pipelines.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Foundation Model Integration</strong>: Researching effective strategies for integrating and grounding LLMs with external knowledge bases, specialized models (e.g., computer vision, robotics), and real-time data to enhance agent performance and reliability.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explainability and Trust in Agents (XAI)</strong>: Developing methods to ensure that the decisions and complex reasoning processes of agentic LLMs are interpretable, fair, and transparent, addressing concerns of trust and safety in high-stakes applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reinforcement Learning for Language Agents</strong>: Applying RL techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and other alignment strategies, to fine-tune LLMs for improved agent performance, alignment with human values, and complex action selection.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        The driving force behind our research is the quest to understand, build, and deploy intelligent language agents that can effectively reason, adapt, and operate autonomously, pushing the frontier of Artificial General Intelligence.
